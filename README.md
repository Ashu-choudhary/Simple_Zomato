# SIMPLE ZOMATO

In Kotlin, I created a sophisticated Food Ordering Application that enabled users to effortlessly peruse restaurant menus, pick out their desired dishes, and complete orders from a variety of local eateries. The application leveraged the cutting-edge capabilities of Kotlin to deliver a fluid and highly responsive user interface, as well as robust user authentication to ensure security. Additionally, the application boasted an intricate order history tracking feature, elevating the overall user experience by providing detailed insights into past orders.
