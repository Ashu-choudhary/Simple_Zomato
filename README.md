# SIMPLE ZOMATO

I have developed a system that utilizes a webcam to capture hand movements in real-time. The captured hand movements are then processed using the OpenCV computer vision library to detect specific gestures. This system allows users to control the volume of a device by making specific hand gestures, such as raising or lowering fingers.
